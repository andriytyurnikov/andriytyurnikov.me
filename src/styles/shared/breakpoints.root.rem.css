/*
 * RESPONSIVE REM SCALE
 * ====================
 *
 * The Problem:
 * CSS has no access to viewing distance. We can't measure visual angle directly.
 * But visual angle (degrees) is the true ergonomic unit — what matters is how large
 * something appears to the eye, not its pixel size.
 *
 * The Solution:
 * Infer device tier from screen resolution, then scale root font-size to approximate
 * angular consistency. This makes rem a practical stand-in for degrees.
 *
 * The Scale:
 * Base unit = 4px, multiplied by tier (4 through 8):
 *
 *   | Device     | Multiplier | Root font | Typical distance |
 *   |------------|------------|-----------|------------------|
 *   | Mobile     | ×4         | 16px      | ~30cm            |
 *   | Tablet     | ×5         | 20px      | ~40cm            |
 *   | Laptop     | ×6         | 24px      | ~50cm            |
 *   | Desktop    | ×7         | 28px      | ~60cm            |
 *   | Desktop 4K | ×8         | 32px      | ~70cm            |
 *
 * Result:
 * 1rem ≈ same visual angle across all device tiers.
 * Key ratio: 1° ≈ 2.4rem
 *
 * Practical dimensions:
 * - Portrait mobile width: ~24rem ≈ 10°
 * - Body text max-width: 40rem ≈ 16.7° (comfortable reading without head movement)
 *
 * This replaces the traditional "60 character line length" rule with an
 * angular-based approach that automatically adapts across devices.
